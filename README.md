An end-to-end system for detecting and analyzing fraudulent SMS traffic at telecom scale.  
This project combines exploratory analysis, anomaly detection, supervised learning, and a production-ready dashboard ‚Äî designed not just as a prototype, but as an **operator-level fraud intelligence tool**.

## üìå Overview  

Billions of SMS messages flow through telecom networks daily. Hidden within them lies a fraction of traffic that represents fraud ‚Äî small in volume, but significant in impact.  

This framework was built to uncover those invisible patterns using a **multi-layered approach**:  

- **Quantile-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify anomaly thresholds.  
- **Isolation Forest** for unsupervised outlier discovery.  
- **Clustering** as a diagnostic instrument to validate anomaly structures.  
- **Random Forest** classifier trained on labeled anomalies, optimized for high recall.  
- **Streamlit dashboard** to operationalize detection with scalability and usability.

## üî¨ Methodology  

1. **EDA as Foundation**  
   - Performed quantile drilling (every 5%) across millions of SMS logs.  
   - Determined 0.1% (‚âà0.001) as the logical anomaly ratio.  

2. **Anomaly Discovery & Labeling**  
   - Detected anomalies via Isolation Forest.  
   - Used clustering to interpret anomaly distribution.  
   - Converted signals into labeled fraud datasets.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Trained a Random Forest classifier for supervised detection.  
   - Prioritized **high recall** to minimize missed fraud cases.  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Built a Streamlit app with:  
     - Multi-format support (CSV, Parquet, ZIP).  
     - Sender-level aggregation & ranking.  
     - Exportable anomaly reports.  
     - Interactive charts for anomaly distributions.

## ‚ö° Features  

- Scalable scoring for **multi-million row datasets**.  
- Hybrid fraud detection: **Isolation Forest + Random Forest**.  
- Operator-grade interface with **Streamlit**.  
- Exportable anomaly insights for investigation teams.
